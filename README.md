# Chapter16writingAndReadingObjects
Chapter 16 writing And Reading Objects. In this project, you will practice writing objects to a file, then reading objects from a file. This is a little different than writing and reading plain text. Create a project that has a StudentList class that can be written to a file. Instantiate an object of that class. Write that object to a file; modify it, display it with changes, and write it to the file; then modify it again, display it with those changes, and write it to the file. So the same object is written to the file 3 times, and all 3 versions of that object should be in the file when done. To check that, read all 3 objects from the file and display each one.
